 <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
 <br>
 <ul>
  <li><h5>What is freight forwarding, and do I even need it?</h5>
      <p>Freight forwarders are responsible for arranging transportation of your cargo around the world. While it is entirely possible to
         arrange your own freight services, we have the expertise and reliable contacts to help you do so more efficiently and
         cost-effectively.</p>
  <br>
  <li><h5>What documents do I need for a shipment?</h5>
      <p>The documents you need will depend on the shipment details. The customs requirements differ for every country.
         Minimally, we will need Commercial Invoice & Packing List. Additional documents such as Material Safety Data Sheet
         (MSDS) for dangerous goods, company license for controlled cargoes etc. may be needed.</p></li>

      <p>Regrettably, we are currently only able to handle requests in English. (Documents do not need to be in English,
         email/tel correspondence does though)</p></li>
